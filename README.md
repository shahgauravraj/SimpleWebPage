![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shahgauravraj/ExpenseMonitor/master/assets/images/Web%201920%20%E2%80%93%201.png)

This is a modern web application build using HTML and CSS basics having very few features. All the images and backgrounds used for this website are either downloaded from web or designed using Adobe XD(for example, the feature image).

## What is this app for me?
This a Front-end development Learning project where I aim to learn how I can make this web application visually appealing as well as user-friendly, at the same time making it adaptive and responsive towards all array of device sizes and platforms. In the future, I also plan to add all the necessary backend or database related functionalities.

### Project Status
The app is at its very primitive stage, a lot of work is to be done.
